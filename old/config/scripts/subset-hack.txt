Be aware that although I've labelled the sections
in this, it's done with characters I want in the
subset anyway. It may not be wise to do so in general
as this entire file's contents is in the subset.

Numbers:
1234567890

Text:
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

Language symbols:
.?!;:,`'"()[]@&

Mathematical symbols:
+-/\*()[]{}<>=

All the other symbols:
~@#$%^&*_|

I'm sure eventually we'll need international
diacriticals in here. Don't be afraid to
request them if you're writing something for
the game and need them.
